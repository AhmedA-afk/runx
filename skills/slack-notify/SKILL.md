# Slack Notify

Send one deliberate Slack channel notification without exposing a Slack token
to the skill or letting approved content drift before delivery. The skill
separates safe message planning from the consequential provider mutation and
requires Slack readback before it calls the notification delivered.

Use this for bounded notifications to a known workspace and channel. It is not
a team inbox, a Slack history reader, or a customer-support workflow. Higher-
level operator skills may prepare the message and destination, but this skill
owns the final channel-post boundary.

## Composes

<!-- Generated from the native execution closure; run pnpm core-skills:composes:generate. -->

- `send-as#plan`

## Runners

The default `notify` runner plans, requests approval only at the live post,
delivers once, and requires independent readback. `plan` validates a channel name, channel id, or exact
`slack://workspace/channel` destination, computes an inline message digest with
Runx's native `data.digest`, and binds that digest, the named principal, and the
send intent through the canonical `send-as` planning model. It does not post
and needs no approval. Delivery still requires the exact connector locator.

`plan_exact` is for an operator that has already selected one exact Slack destination, principal, and text under its own policy. It reuses the same notification validation and native digest, then emits the same undelivered `runx.notify.v1` plan without a second model judgment. Its `send_plan.origin` is `slack-notify.exact`, not a claim that `send-as#plan` ran. It does not authorize delivery: `deliver` still requires a matching native human approval or a configured standing notification authority and independent readback.

`deliver` accepts only that exact plan, the matching destination and message
text, and a stable UUID idempotency key. Runx recomputes the digest and compares
the complete delivery binding without echoing message content. It then:

1. stops unless exact native human approval or a matching standing notification authority is present;
2. resolves the configured provider binding for `channel.post` and the
   follow-up `channel.post.read`;
3. asks the selected provider transport to execute that bounded mutation while
   its credential boundary retains custody; and
4. reads the returned message locator back from Slack, compares the exact
   locator, destination, content digest, and occurrence time, then seals only
   those bounded evidence fields.

The binding may be local, self-hosted, third-party, or Runx-hosted. The skill
never receives a Slack token, constructs a raw HTTP request, owns a tenant, or
stores connector credentials in its inputs or receipts.

## Inputs and result

Generic planning needs the principal, exact Slack locator, message text, purpose, and
any audience constraints required by `send-as`. Exact planning needs only the fixed principal, locator, and content; the caller owns the prior selection. Delivery needs the resulting
`notify_plan`, identical locator and text, and stable idempotency key.

A plan ends as not sent. A delivery is valid only when the sealed
`runx.provider.operation.v1` packet identifies the Slack operation and carries
the provider-returned message locator, conversation locator, content digest,
and occurrence time for the posted message. The follow-up channel-post readback must
resolve that exact locator. Provider acceptance without those expected fields,
the exact destination and content identity, and the stable-id readback is not
enough.

## Stop conditions

- Stop on plan, destination, content-digest, principal, or audience drift.
- Stop when both human approval and standing notification authority are absent or denied.
- Refuse a missing, ambiguous, wrong-provider, or insufficient-scope Slack
  binding for either operation rather than falling back to a raw token.
- Replays may reuse the same idempotency binding only for the exact same post;
  changed content must not inherit the old approval.
- Do not call a sealed plan “delivered” and do not manufacture provider
  readback in a fixture or agent answer.

## Example

An operator plans “release 2.4 is verified” for one internal channel. Approval
binds that exact text and destination. If the text changes to include another
claim, delivery refuses the digest mismatch. With a matching plan and one valid
Slack binding, the provider operation posts and returns the Slack message id;
the follow-up channel-post readback resolves that id, and those provider observations—not
the local plan—prove delivery.
